Over the years I've found myself with an ever growing library of games on Steam. When [Valve revamped their Steam library](https://store.steampowered.com/libraryupdate) back in late 2019 they added dynamic collections on top of their static collections. [There still isn't a way to have logical functions like "and" and "or"](https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-finally-lets-you-take-control-of-your-game-collection-but-needs-more-options/), but there's now more things to filter by (Steam Deck compatibility, games both you and a friend own, and if games work with [Remote Play Together](https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay)). It's been an invaluable tool to help filter my library. Here are some of the (silly) ways I use it.

## What is a Steam library collection?

It's a way for you to organize your Steam library into custom collections (i.e. categories) of your choosing.

Whenever you click on a game in your library, in the top right of the game's banner you can see all the collections it's in. Which is very helpful if you make certain collections like I mention below.

And you don't need a huge backlog of games to use collections either!

## How to create a Steam library collection

First off, this is how to make a new collection. In the Steam desktop app, hover over the "Library" tab, and you'll see a few options, namely "Home", "Collections", and "Downloads". Click on "Collections" and you'll see all collections you have created so far, and a button to create a new one. Click the "Create a new collection" button and you'll be greeted with a popup. Here you can choose if you'd like to create a static collection (you need to add games to it manually) or a dynamic collection (you enter in the criteria and Steam auto-adds games that match).

**Static collection**: after you create one, you can add games to it either by:
- dragging and dropping games into it
- or by right-clicking on a game in the list and adding it to any static collection you've made

**Dynamic collection**: after you create one, you can edit the filters/criteria. And if you don't like that a certain game has been added, you can remove it from appearing in the collection.

## Ideas for static collections

- **Games that have their quirks**. If I find a game can't alt-tab without crashing ([Caesar 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/517790/Caesar_3/)), or can only be played when your monitor is set to 60hz ([Minit](https://store.steampowered.com/app/609490/Minit/)), I make a new collection for each quirk and add the game to it. So if/when I ever go back to the game, I don't have to rediscover these issues.
- **Did I play this with a controller, or mouse/keyboard?** I have a few collections that are just which hardware I used to play each game. Sometimes if I take a year or more break from playing a game (looking at you [Hitman](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659040/HITMAN_3/)) I can't remember if I played it with a controller or mouse/keyboard. But having this collection is helpful so I end up using the same device so (most of) my muscle memory comes back. These are the collections I have:
	- controller - [DS4](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows)
	- controller - xbox
	- controller - mouse/keyboard
	- controller - mouse
	- controller - keyboard
- **Games you've completed**. You can decide if that means a game you are likely not to revisit again, or games where you've just completed the main story.
- **Games you would like to 100%**. You can decide if that means completing all in-game objectives/achievements, or just completing all Steam achievements.
- **Games that are endless**. Games that don't really have an end or that I can keep going back to, I put into this collection.
- **Games that work with your VR headset**. I have a Windows Mixed Reality headset and some games don't have native support for it. So any games I've found that worked on the headset, I've added to a collection.

## Ideas for dynamic collections

- **Games both you and your Steam friend own**. Your friend might need their privacy settings for "Game details" set to either Public or Friends Only for this to work, but it's a great way to quickly see what games you both own. Especially if you also filter by co-op or multiplayer games.
- **Games that work with [Remote Play Together](https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay)**. This is hands down my favourite feature. I love being able to play any local co-op game over the internet with friends, with near zero lag on some games (granted if you have a decent internet connection and good hardware). So naturally I have a dynamic collection so I can see what games I can play with friends. My current favourites are [PlateUp!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599600/PlateUp/), [Travellers Rest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1139980/Travellers_Rest/), and [The Skywalker Saga](https://store.steampowered.com/app/920210/LEGO_Star_Wars_The_Skywalker_Saga/).
- **Unplayed games**. Great for finding the next game to play in your backlog (or understand how large your backlog really is).
- **Steam Deck verified games**. If you own a Steam Deck, this is a great filter to have. You can filter by:
	- games that are "Steam Deck verified" (meaning the game works out of the box)
	- or "verified and playable" (shows all verified games, but playable games might need some tinkering)
	- or "verified and playable and untested" (shows all the verified and playable games, but also games that are untested on Steam Deck)
- **Games with the VR tag**. If you happen to have a VR headset and want to see if you already own games with VR support, this is the filter for you. Games like [Phasmophobia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/), [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://store.steampowered.com/app/341800/Keep_Talking_and_Nobody_Explodes/), and [Subnautica](https://store.steampowered.com/app/264710/Subnautica/) have VR compatibility shipped along with the base game. Unlike some other games, [looking at you Skyrim](https://screenrant.com/skyrim-release-how-many-consoles-times-what-when/).
